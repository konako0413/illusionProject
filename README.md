# illusionProject

## 📜 Project Description
The work I created is an illusion that combines the zollner illusion and the spiral illusion. mr.takahashi's work is an oval shape that grows larger as it moves outward and is actually a concentric circle, but if you focus on the center, you can see a spiral It was an illusion. I tried to see if I could see the same illusion by changing the oval to a heart and the color to red. I placed it in the same way as the basic zollner spiral illusion and tried two different angles of the heart mark. One is that all the sharp edges of the hearts are oriented toward the center of the concentric circles (version 1). (version 1) Then, the angle of each concentric circle was changed. In this case, they appeared to be drawn into the center as in the zollner illusion. In addition, I felt that I could see lines of concentric circles that did not actually exist. Also, the shape of a flower appeared to appear.

Next, the pointed parts of the heart mark were arranged in a series of spirals. In other words, they were arranged to form a spiral of equal 45 degree angles. (version 2) Then, the pointed part of the heart mark was able to play the role of the line part of the zollner spiral illusion. We are investigating the possibility that the human brain naturally connects the pointed parts of the heart to each other.

## 📂 Files

The basic zollner spiral illusion recreating can be found in the zollner illusion file.
Version 1 can be found by opening the Heart Flower file.
Version 2 can be found by opening the Heart Spiral file.
